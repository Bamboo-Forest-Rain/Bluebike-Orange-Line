# Background

On August 18, 2022, the Boston MBTA’s Orange Line was shut down for a month due to safety repair work. To open more transportation options for Orange Line commuters, Mayor Wu announced that Bluebikes, Boston’s bikeshare system, would be free during the month of the shutdown. During the month, bikeshare demand surged tremendously, bypassing expectations of demand even for the free period. Monthly ridership has increased by over 100,000 in August and September in 2022, a growth of nearly 40% from the previous year. 

# Research Question

Essentially, this project explores the effect of orange line shutdown and free bikeshare service on ridership. To see effects, the following questions are answered: 

* What new trend did we see during the shutdown period?
- What areas' riderships have been impacted the most by the orange line shutdown and the free bikeshare service?
- After Bikeshare became free, what variables contributed ot the increase in demand?
